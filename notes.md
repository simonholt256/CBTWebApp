- thinking phallecys (cognitive distortions) - will the thought past the test??
now rememeber just because it didn't seem to fit into these catergories doesn't mean a whole lot, its possible that it did but it is just so convincing that it managed to escape you rigorious test. But of course, its possible that it didn't and that is going to happen. Sometime negative thoughts don't fall apart away so easily. Life has hard moments and everyone (literally everyone!) has tiems of sadness and distress. The import thing is how to deal with it. If you are not too overwhelemed there is nothing wrong with sitting with a feeling, feeling negative things has no moral right or wrong (thinking that way can sometimes make a thought seem worse than it is). But if you are overwhelmed there are some simple next steps. just means that 
- catch a thought. Part of creating a healthy relationship with your own thoughts is learning to recognise which thoughts might spiral into something worst, but what to do when you recognise them?
